# Skill Heaven console (preview)
Use `/skill-heaven-console:heaven`. This is a model-mediated command report, not a native pane or HUD.
Resolve `../../scripts/heaven.mjs` relative to THIS SKILL.md's directory. Run Node with that script and `--host agy`. If the person provides the exact Core sessionRoot reported in THIS conversation, add `--session-root` and that root as a separate argument. Alternatively the person may provide `--transcript` and the exact current conversation's transcript_full.jsonl path. Never select newest, scan brain directories, guess a conversation id, read another conversation, or export prompts. A missing binding means unknown counts. Return stdout verbatim; execute no printed scope or handoff commands. Do not change /statusline or user configuration.

Only on explicit `/skill-heaven-console:heaven lens <need>`: call the existing Core server `skill-heaven_skill-summon`, tool `summon`, once with `{query: <need>, surface: "any", preview: true}`. No separate engine, no materialization, no candidate body read. Bind the report to that result's exact sessionRoot. A human may type a printed `/skill-heaven:summon <name>`; never submit it. State that preview/report are model-mediated. If Core is unavailable, say so.
